# U-NET Model

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the U-NET model, a popular architecture for semantic segmentation in image processing. The model is implemented using the Keras library.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary packages. You can do this by running the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/milaomrani/U-NET.git
cd U-NET
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

You can use the U-NET model by importing the `multi_unet_model` function from the `unet_model.py` script. Here is an example:

```python
from unet_model import multi_unet_model

# Create a U-NET model
model = multi_unet_model(n_classes=6, IMG_HEIGHT=256, IMG_WIDTH=256, IMG_CHANNELS=1)

# Compile the model (add your preferred optimizer and loss function)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Now you can train the model with your data
```
